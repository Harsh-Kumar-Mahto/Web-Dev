"Virtual DOM" is a concept which is not used now a days but was very popular back then
In Virtual DOM, js creates its own DOM(tree like structure) as that of browser and then
whenever any change is done, not the whole browser DOM is repainted(page reload) but the trees are compared
and the changed parts are updated.

"Reconciliation" is the algorithm that react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which part needs to be changed.
Behind the scene, this is the algorithm which is considered as the Virtual DOM

But when changes are made too fast that best option is to hold some changes and directly update the final change
there was a need of more optimized technique that can hold for some time so it does not need to apply changes again and again
This implementation is called the "React Fibre". It does following things:
1.Pause work and come back to it later.
2.Assign priority to different types of work.
3.Reuse previously completed work.
4.Abort work if it's no longer needed.
