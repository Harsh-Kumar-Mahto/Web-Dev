    <h1>Events in JS</h1>
    <p>Change in state of an object is known as an Event</p>
    <p>Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mouse events(click,double click etc)</li>
        <li>Keyboard events(keypress,keyup,keydown)</li>
        <li>Form events(submit,etc.)</li>
        <li>Print event & many more</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 1.Inline event handling:We are handling different kinds of events in there respective tags  -->
    <!-- Drawback is the lengthyness of the code -->
    <h1>Inline Event Handling</h1>
    <button onclick="console.log('Button was clicked');alert('hello')">Click me!</button>
    <button ondblclick="console.log('Button was clicked');alert('hello')">Click me twice!</button>
    <br><br><div onmouseover="console.log('mouse inside div')">This div will track hover of mouse</div>

    <!-- 2.JS handling:More priority and is better -->
    <!-- Drawback is that we can handle only one function at a time -->
    <h1>JS Event Handling</h1>
    <br><br><div id="event">Event handled in JS file</div>


    <h1>Event Object</h1>
    <p>Every event has a special object that has details about it</p>
    <p>All event handlers have access to the Event Objec's properties and methods</p>

    <!-- 3.Event Listeners -->
    <!-- Same event can be addressed multiple times -->
    <h1>Event Listener</h1>
    <br><br><div id="box1">Event handled in JS file</div>
    <!-- We can remove the eventListener in the same way we added it and the callback function should be same -->
