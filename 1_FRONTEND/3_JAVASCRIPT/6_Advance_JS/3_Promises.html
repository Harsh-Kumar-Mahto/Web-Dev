    <h1>Promises</h1>
    <p>Promise is for eventual completion of task.It is an object in JS.It is a solution of callback hell</p>
    <p>A promise has 3 states:pending(result undefined),resolved(fulfilled(with result as a value)) and rejected(the result is an error object)</p>
    <p>resolve and reject are 2 handlers(callBacks) of Promise object in JS</p>
    <p>we use the code in promise.then() if our promise is resolved</p>
    <p>if promise is rejected,we use promise.catch()</p>
