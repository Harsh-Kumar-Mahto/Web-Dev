    <h3>Window Object</h3>
    <p>Window object represents an open window in a browser.It is a browser's object(not Javascript's)
       & is automatically created by browser.</p>
    <p>It is a global object with lots of properties and methods such as console.log/alert and all we used previously</p>
    <h1>DOM(Document Object Model)</h1>
    <p>When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page</p>
    <p>This document can be seen in window object and it contains all the code of our html file</p>
    <p>This is done so that we can perform changes dynamically through js in our website which is not possible through html/css</p>
