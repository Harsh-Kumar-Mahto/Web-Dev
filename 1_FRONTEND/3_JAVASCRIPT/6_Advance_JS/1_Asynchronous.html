    <h1>Synchronous</h1>
    <p>Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution</p>
    <h1>Asynchronous</h1>
    <p>Due to sychronous programming,sometimes imp instructions get bocked due to some previous instructions,which causes a delay in the UI.
        Aynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't blick the flow.
